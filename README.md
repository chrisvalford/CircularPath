# CircularPath
## Sample SwiftUI project
## Demonstrating:
- IVO Pattern from Rebeloper - [Rebel Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOA0IT7sxvc)
- Use of GeometryProxy to create sub-views within the model
## TODO:
- Fix the position of the circular spots, currently uses 22 and not the correct navigation height.
- Fix the inital drawing of the spots so (lazy initialization) so they are not re-drawn incorrectly.
- Move more of the data functions from the observed object into the models.
